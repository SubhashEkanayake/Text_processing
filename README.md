# Text_processing
This program assumes that there is a text file named "example.txt" in the same directory as the program, and it processes the text in that file. It reads each word from the file, removes any punctuation characters from the word, and then counts the number of words and calculates the average word length.

Please note that this is a basic example and does not handle all possible text processing scenarios. In a real-world application, you may need to consider other factors like handling different word delimiters, case sensitivity, and more advanced text processing tasks such as stemming, tokenization, and natural language processing.
